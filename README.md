# Expresso Churn Prediction App

This project is a web application built with Streamlit for predicting customer churn for Expresso, a telecommunications company operating in Africa. The app provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to log in and upload customer data for churn prediction.

## Features

- **Admin Login Page**: Secure login for administrators.
- **Model Loading**: Load a pre-trained neural network model for churn prediction.
- **Prediction Page**: Upload customer data in CSV format and predict churn probabilities.
- **Download Results**: Download the prediction results with churn probabilities.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the required libraries using pip:

```sh
pip install streamlit pandas joblib
```

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/expresso-churn-prediction.git
cd expresso-churn-prediction
```

2. **Prepare the Model**: Place your pre-trained model file (`model.pkl`) in the specified directory (`C:\\Users\\Bunmi\\Documents\\Streamlit Project\\`).

3. **Run the Streamlit App**: Execute the Streamlit application.

```sh
streamlit run app.py
```

Replace `app.py` with the name of your Python script file if it's different.

4. **Log In**: Open the Streamlit interface in your browser, enter the admin credentials (username: `gomycode`, password: `gomycode_1`), and log in.

5. **Predict Churn**: Navigate to the "Prediction" page, upload a CSV file containing customer data, and view the churn predictions. Optionally, download the results.

## Code Overview

### Import Libraries

```python
import streamlit as st
import pandas as pd
import joblib
```

### Define the Login Page

```python
def login_page():
    st.title("Admin Login")
    username = st.text_input("Username")
    password = st.text_input("Password", type="password")

    if username == "gomycode" and password == "gomycode_1":
        st.session_state["authenticated"] = True
        st.success("You are logged in!")
    else:
        st.error("Invalid username or password")
```

### Load the Pre-trained Model

```python
def load_model():
    model_path = "Models.pkl"
    try:
        model = joblib.load("C:\\Users\\Bunmi\\Documents\\Streamlit Project\\model.pkl")
        st.success("Neural network model loaded successfully!")
        return model
    except Exception as e:
        st.error(f"Error loading the model: {e}")
        return None
```

### Define the Prediction Page

```python
def predict():
    model = load_model()
    st.title("Churn Prediction")
    uploaded_file = st.file_uploader("Upload a CSV file", type=["csv"])
    if uploaded_file:
        df = pd.read_csv(uploaded_file)
        churn_probabilities = model.predict(df)
        df['Churn_Probability'] = churn_probabilities
        st.dataframe(df)

        if st.button("Download Results"):
            df.to_csv("churn_predictions.csv", index=False)
            st.success("Prediction results downloaded!")
```

### Main Application Structure

```python
def main():
    if "authenticated" not in st.session_state:
        st.title("Expresso Churn Prediction App")
        login_page()
        return

    st.title("Expresso Churn Prediction")
    st.write("A web app to predict customer churn for Expresso, a telecommunications company in Africa.")

    page = st.sidebar.selectbox("Select a page", ["Home", "Prediction"])

    if page == "Home":
        st.header("About Expresso")
        st.write(
            "Expresso provides telecommunication services in Mauritania and Senegal. This web app helps predict customer churn, allowing Expresso to take proactive measures and retain valuable clients."
        )

    if page == "Prediction":
        predict()

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
